As a developer with a passion for technology, I have always been interested in staying up-to-date on the latest trends and developments in the field. Recently, I have decided to focus my career on site reliability engineering (SRE), and have been learning about the best practices and techniques for building and maintaining highly available and scalable systems.

In my free time, I enjoy reading about the latest technologies and keeping my skills sharp by working on personal projects with my raspberry pi. I am particularly interested in embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT), and enjoy exploring the ways in which these technologies can be used to create innovative and practical solutions.

Whether working on complex systems or exploring the latest advances in technology, I am driven by a desire to create solutions that are both innovative and practical, and that make a positive impact on the world. I am excited about the potential of SRE to transform the way we develop and operate software, and am eager to continue learning and growing in this field.
